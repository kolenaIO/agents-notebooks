# Kolena Agents – Example Jupyter Notebooks 📓

Welcome to **`agents-notebooks`**, the companion repository for the
[`kolena-agents`](https://pypi.org/project/kolena-agents/) Python client.
Here you’ll find ready-to-run Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate common
workflows when building, running, and analyzing Kolena Agents.

> **What are Kolena Agents?**  
> Kolena Agents let you wrap large-language-model (LLM) prompts, tools, and
> evaluation logic into reproducible “agents” that run against your own
> files, datasets, or APIs.  
> Learn more at [agents.kolena.com](https://agents.kolena.com).

| **`quickstart.ipynb`** | End-to-end walk-through: install the client, create an agent, upload files, retrieve results, and optionally delete data. |

Additional notebooks will be added over time (fine-tuning, advanced
filtering, bulk operations, etc.). Feel free to open an issue with
suggestions!
